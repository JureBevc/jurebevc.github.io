      <description>Neural networks are a popular and powerful tool in machine learning techniques. These networks can be used, implemented and designed in various ways, so that they best fit the problem they are trying to solve. At its most basic form, the neural network is represented by a connected set of nodes. Every connected is assigned a weight, that changes the information that travels between connected nodes.
The performance of these networks can differ greatly depending on how we adjust these weights.</description>
