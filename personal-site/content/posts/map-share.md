With MapShare you can take photos and share them with people across
the entire world map. The user can take pictures and publish them on
the world map at their current location. All users can then browse
the map and see what other people have published. Any published
content is removed from the map after 24 hours.

This project was developed using React Native with
[Expo](https://expo.io/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

This app was build as a proof of concept. The source code of this
project as well as a pre-release demo is available on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/JureBevc/mapshare). The
current build is only supported for Android devices.
