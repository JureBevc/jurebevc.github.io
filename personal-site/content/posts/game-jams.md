Games that are created in a short amount of time on a specific theme. 

Games jams are a fun way to do quick and interesting group projects.
Although you can always compete in them alone, it's always more
enjoyable with your friends or even strangers.

One of the most popular game jams is the Ludum Dare, where I
participate with my friends whenever I get a chance. All of our
Ludum Dare submissions can be viewed on my
[profile page](https://ldjam.com/users/neonian/games). We
also submitted one game to the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/companion-3).
