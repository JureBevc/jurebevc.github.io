      <description>Since there are not many free tools available for quick and easy web scraping, I created my own web crawler for basic data scraping. The project is available on my GitHub. The web crawler uses the selenium framework with the geckodriver web driver to scrape websites and the Tkinter toolkit to create a simple GUI for quick use:
This crawler was used to scrape over 4000 vaccination tweets from Twitter. The dataset is available on Kaggle.</description>

      <description>With MapShare you can take photos and share them with people across the entire world map. The user can take pictures and publish them on the world map at their current location. All users can then browse the map and see what other people have published. Any published content is removed from the map after 24 hours.
This project was developed using React Native with Expo and Firebase.
This app was build as a proof of concept.</description>

      <description>Neural networks are a popular and powerful tool in machine learning techniques. These networks can be used, implemented and designed in various ways, so that they best fit the problem they are trying to solve. At its most basic form, the neural network is represented by a connected set of nodes. Every connected is assigned a weight, that changes the information that travels between connected nodes.
The performance of these networks can differ greatly depending on how we adjust these weights.</description>

      <description>There are several wonderful ways to visualize and represent numbers, but one that interesed me the most is doing it through music. Since there are no simple and widely available tools to transform arbitrary numbers into music, I decided to make my own.
The most popular musical scales are the major and the minor scales, each with 7 unique notes. One can simply translate a number to a musical scale, by playing the first note for number 0, the second note for number 1 and so on.</description>

      <description>Games that are created in a short amount of time on a specific theme.
Games jams are a fun way to do quick and interesting group projects. Although you can always compete in them alone, it&amp;rsquo;s always more enjoyable with your friends or even strangers.
One of the most popular game jams is the Ludum Dare, where I participate with my friends whenever I get a chance. All of our Ludum Dare submissions can be viewed on my profile page.</description>
