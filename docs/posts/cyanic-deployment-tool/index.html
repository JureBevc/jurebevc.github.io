I developed Cyanic, a lightweight blue-green deployment tool written in Go. This journey has been incredibly rewarding, and I think it might resonate with fellow developers looking for a simpler way to manage deployments.\nWhy Build Cyanic For those who might not be familiar, blue-green deployment is a strategy that allows you to switch between two identical environments—let’s call them “blue” and “green”—to ensure smooth updates with minimal downtime. Traditionally, this can be complex, but I wanted to create a tool that simplifies this process, especially for small to medium-sized applications.\nAs I was working on personal projects and smaller applications, I found that many deployment tools were either too complicated or tied to Docker, which I wasn’t using. I wanted something straightforward that could run behind an Nginx proxy without the fuss. So, I rolled up my sleeves and created Cyanic.\nGetting Started with Cyanic You have two options for installation:\nDownload the Compiled Program: If you want to skip the setup hassle, you can simply download the precompiled binary directly from the releases section on the Cyanic GitHub Repository. This is the quickest way to get up and running.\nInstall from Source: If you prefer to build from source or want to customize it, you can install Cyanic as a Go package.\ngo get -u github.com/JureBevc/cyanic Just a quick note: you’ll need a few dependencies on your deployment server, such as nginx, systemctl, disown, and fuser. But if you’re already running a server, you probably have those covered.\nUsing Cyanic Cyanic has a range of commands that make deploying and managing applications a breeze. Here are some of my favorites:\nHelp Command: Whenever I need a quick reminder of the commands, I just run:\ncyanic help To push my latest changes to staging, I simply use:\ncyanic deploy-staging Once I’m ready to go live, swapping environments takes just one command:\ncyanic swap I can quickly check the health of my applications with:\ncyanic health-staging cyanic health-production For a fully automated deploy, I use:\ncyanic full-deploy This command handles everything—from deploying to staging, running health checks, swapping, and checking production again.\nConfiguration Cyanic uses a configuration file (cyanic.yaml) where you can specify your deployment settings. I made sure to include examples in the repository to help you get started quickly. Having a structured way to manage settings has made my deployments more organized and less prone to error.\nConclusion If you’re looking for a straightforward tool to manage blue-green deployments without the overhead of Docker or complicated setups, I recommend giving Cyanic a shot.You can check out the Cyanic GitHub Repository to get started. I’d love to hear your thoughts and any experiences you’ve had with deployment tools.\n","wordCount":"467","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-01-03T21:14:30+02:00","dateModified":"2025-01-03T21:14:30+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jurebevc.com/posts/cyanic-deployment-tool/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jure Bevc","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jurebevc.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jurebevc.com/ accesskey=h title="  (Alt + H)"><img src=https://jurebevc.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35></a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://jurebevc.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://jurebevc.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Cyanic - A blue/green deployment tool</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-03 21:14:30 +0200 +0200'>January 3, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;467 words</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>I’ve been working a tool that has changed the way I handle application deployments for personal projects.
